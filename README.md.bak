## Directory Information

USK-coffee contains 3 folders:
* train (training data is used to train machine learning models)
* val (validation data is used to confirm or validate classification performance during neural network training and prevent overfitting)
* test (test data is used to test the performance of the model that has been made)

In 3 folder contains the following 4 subfolders or 4 classes of green bean coffee:

* defect (Defects have shaped not been intact and broken, seem hollow, and turn black)

you can see the table below for the total number image of each class
